    Placeholder for future tests of the linear algebra MDP implementation.
    
    Previous test used deprecated value iteration methods. New tests should focus on
    testing the linear algebra solution approach.
    
    Potential test ideas:
    - Verify that V = (I - Î³P)^(-1)R for a given policy
    - Check optimality of computed policy on small boards
    - Test convergence properties of policy iteration
